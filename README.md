# Nuxt-Gen

> cli to generate templated nuxt files

- Planning to Support both Typescript and JavaScript
  - Typescript will be first since I use it and can test easily
- Planning to support generation for at least:
  - components
  - services
  - middleware
  - server-middleware
  - pages
  - layouts
  - store
- Support options for templates i.e.
  - Class based Vue Components
  - Options based Vue components
