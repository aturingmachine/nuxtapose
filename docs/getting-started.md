# Getting Started

This guide should help you get nuxtapose integrated into your workflow as quickly as possible.

## Installation

It is recommended to install nuxtapose globally:

```bash
npm install -g nuxtapose
```

## Configuration Wizard

The Configuration Wizard can be invoked by running any valid command without a `nuxtaposerc.json` or by running the `init` command:

```bash
nuxtapose init
```

The Configuration Wizard will walk you through setting options for template generation. Once completed you will now have a `.nuxtaposerc.json` in the root directory of your project.
